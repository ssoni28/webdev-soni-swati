## Project
### Title: MASSIVEX

### Description
MASSIVEX, a web application, is a cryptocurrency exchange platform that will allow the exchange of one type of cryptocurrency into other. With a simple register and secured login process, a user will be able to create a brain wallet and easily trade a leading blockchain asset for other. This project is a Single Page Application built using MEAN stack, HTML5, CSS3 and some external APIs.

### Problem Statement
With the invention of cryptocurrency and new assets being mined, there is a call for a platform which can easily convert one asset into other. As we know, the exchange rates keep on changing and the value of a particular type of asset is also fluctuating every moment depending on the market. In such scenarios, people prefer to convert their current assets to some other which might benefit them in present or future. Here, the requirement is to build a secure system which will provide an easy way of exchanging assets, buy and sell blockchain assets, get notified and assisted in real time.

### Proposed Solution
MASSIVEX is the solution for the above-stated problem. This is a web application serving the purpose of exchanging cryptocurrency in simple steps. This application will server following functions:

* Exchange leading blockchain assets and tokens
* Buy new assets
* Sell assets
* Real-time support to users by live chat
* Real-time exchange rate updates
* 24-hour statistics will add transparency and will also help users to understand the trend
